Hobbs, Jerry R. and Andrew Gordon. ["Goals in a formal theory of commonsense pychology." (PDF)](http://www.isi.edu/~hobbs/goals-fois-may10.pdf) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS-2010), Toronto, Canada, May 11-14, 2010.  
Hobbs and Gordon explain a technique for modeling folk theories of intentional behavior. Introduces the notion of the top-level "Thrive" goal.

Langley, Pat, John E. Laird, and Seth Rogers. [Cognitive Architectures: Research Issues and Challenges](http://www.isle.org/~langley/papers/cogarch.cogsys08.pdf). _Cognitive Systems Research_ 10 no. 2 (2009).  
Discusses current cognitive architectures that exist for organizing large artificial intelligence projects. Also, shared properties of cognitive architectures as well future directions for what is needed is discussed—a rare overview of a very complicated field. This paper was referenced in class when Minsky was wondering if there is a good overview of different types of representations and what problems they are both good and, more importantly, bad at solving.

Singh, Push, Ian Eslick, et al. ["Computing Commonsense." (PDF)](http://web.media.mit.edu/~walter/bttj/Paper22Pages201-210.pdf) _BT Technology Journal_ 22 no. 4 (2004).  
An Overview of How the Commonsense Computing Approach to Building Commonsense Reasoning Systems.

Mueller, Erik T. ["Automating Commonsense Reasoning using Event Calculus." (PDF)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.2771&rep=rep1&type=pdf) _Communications of the ACM_ 52 no. 1 (2009).  
Event Calculus is an extention of First Order logic designed for effectively reasoning about events. While still committed to logical inference, this is a well defined approach to commonsense reasoning and Mueller is very clear communicator.

[Open Mind Commons](http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Mind_Commons)  
The current web-based commonsense knowledge acquisition effort at the MIT Media Lab. The data can be downloaded from [http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/](http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/).

[OpenCYC References](https://www.ime.usp.br/~fr/opencyc/)  
Links to resources and data about Doug Lenet's CYC project, the largest commonsense knowledge base (but unlike OpenMind, it represents its knowledge in its own formalism: CycL, an extension of FOL). Although the company is private, they made the knowledge base open source with OpenCyc. Check out the KB explorer to see examples of its knowledge.

A highly-entertaining video of CMU researcher's thesis on collecting knowledge from people. This approach, known as "human computation", is taken in the OpenMind project.

GoogleTalksArchive. Computers versus Common Sense: Douglas Lenat, May 30, 2006. August 22, 2012. Accessed March 3, 2013. Youtube. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAtn-4fhuWA.  
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAtn-4fhuWA)A very nice talk Lenat gave at Google about the motivations behind the Cyc project and its current state.
