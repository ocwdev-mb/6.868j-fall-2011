**Problem 1.** What are three questions you would be interested in asking Professor Minsky about Chapter 1 of _The Emotion Machine_?

**Problem 2.** What are the most important problems in your field that have been addressed by AI already? What are the most important problems in your field that you think AI could contribute to?

**Problem 3.** The behavior of a complex\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_depends only on how its parts\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, not what type of\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_they're\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Problem 4.** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_s and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_s can react to mental obstacles by switching on and off different\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Problem 5.** What are some advantages and disadvantages of Zato coding? Do they match the requirements for information transfer in the brain, given empirical findings?{{< sup "1" >}} Why or why not?

**Extra Credit.** Implement Zato coding and evaluate its performance on some dataset (ideally, but not necessarily "real data" of some variety) against any other scheme(s) using any well-deﬁned metrics (e.g. throughput, error rate, capacity), explaining why these metrics are appropriate. What did you learn from this experiment?
